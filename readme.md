using api's and learning how they work with ajax 



to fix
**still to do**make city field clear after each entry

**completed**press enter should perform same action as when button clicked inside text field
     methods:
     extracting the contents of a function into a new function
     trigger the click event automagically with trigger() (jquery)

ToDo
**completed**Get the weather when city is chosen from the dropdown
    look up change() handler in jquery


add style
**completed**added css and background w/ some interactive sontent

**still to do**Find why not able to add another city without refresh
